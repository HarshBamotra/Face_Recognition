** Face Recognition using Python **

1. This repository contains files, each to perform a specific task.
2. face_recognition library is used for face_recognition in images.
3. PIL library is used for image processing.

These files are just for getting familiar with face recognition 
using python and are created as a part of a workshop I attended 
organised by our college.
